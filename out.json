\u2013 A exemplary rooftop pub in town which would leave a captivating memory down the pub scene in Namma Bengaluru  For those who are passionate about crafted beer, palatable food and good music ShakesBierre hits the bull\u2019s-eye.  The moment we step in you would be startled to see the entire space being flawlessly setup in a Shakespeare era \u2013 yes you heard me right!  The entire space is setup in old British era - right from dim lighting to art work on the walls, a huge painting that depicts the entire world as a stage. The chairs, furniture and murals at every nook and corner would for sure transport you back to native British era.  I would say they have put forth loads of efforts for the interiors and d\u00e9cor to theme it as a classic Shakespeare themed one.  Ambiance \u2013 5\/5 (For sure deserves a huge round of applause)  We choose to visit this place during weekday dinner and I was quite surprised to see this place running to a full house at 8pm on a weekday.  We were greeted politely by the staff and seated in a place of our choice.  Drinks \u2013 4\/5  Beer \u2013 I personally loved the Ale Othello \u2013 (Indian pale ale), in cocktails I would adore \u201cThe Devil gets his Due\u201d  Ale Othello \u2013 (Indian pale ale) -4\/5  This one has citrus and tropical fruit notes to it and best part is it has a fine balance of sweetness and bitterness from the hops.  Do try this one with Lamb chops which is a perfect pairing.  The Devil get\u2019s his Due \u2013 Request the staff to present this one right in front of you and then see the dramatics around it.  With whiskey as its base it has a right mix of sweetness and a bit of sourness then presented well by adding apple smoke \u2013 the first sip gives it a na\u00efve smoky feel - a perfect one!  Food \u2013 Appetizing one  (Small plates) \u2013 5\/5   Tawa Lamb Chops \u2013 Just the right ones, the meat just falls of the bone and is cooked to perfection. The lamb chops are marinated in rich spices along with ginger , garlic paste. This has a rustic feel to it.  Sambal Prawns \u2013 the melt in the mouth ones loved them  ShakesBierre chips \u2013 A fine mix of Tapioca, raw banana and potato chips, which are seasoned with simple spices   Large Plates: 4\/5  Vietnamese Lamb Curry \u2013 A perfect example of main course which is a show stopper  Lamb shanks cooked for a long time in Vietnamese styled curry along with coconut milk and then topped with curry leaves. This one is just wow.  Mushroom Rendang \u2013 A simple Indonesian rendang curry cooked in rich coconut milk with assorted mushrooms and lemongrass. A strong hint of lemongrass is evident.  Goan Fish Curry \u2013 A simple fish curry cooked with kokum, coconut milk in ground spices. Goes well with steamed rice.  Desserts: 5\/5 (Sinful ones)   Baked Alaska \u2013 A classic one which is then slightly flamb\u00e9ed with Brandy, this one did the trick and boy trust me this is one such dessert you should miss to try when you are at ShakesBierre.  Baked Blueberry cheesecake \u2013 Yet another classic New York style baked cheese cake. This is spot on with right amount of sweetness quo.  Service \u2013 4.5\/5  The staffs are really polite and dutiful in here. They are well versed with the menu.  Best part I remember our attendant \u2013 Bijit \u2013 always has a smiling face and makes sure you would have a wonderful dining experience out there. He has recommended few dishes and they were just wow. People like him make that difference.  VFM -5\/5  ShakesBierre for me is place with skillfully crafted beers and cocktails to accompany a delectable selection of edible treats with native origin.  \u00a0Perfect place with a gastronomic masterpiece along with an upbeat British era interior, aided by some great music tracks being played.  Price for two will come up to 2000 rs \/- with a drink  The service is worth an applaud and food is delicious.

Surrounded by greenery everywhere, you get a plush atmosphere. Coming to the food, had ordered the mutton pepper fry and the Chakhna platter for starters. Both were good but the mutton pepper fry was by far the best I have had so far. Also ordered for a Meaty Pizza which was really good and cheesy and was the right portion size to be shared between 2 ppl. Felt they could have added more variety in their non veg selection by including Beef\/Pork. Although being a brewery, they had amazing cocktails to offer to the non beer drinkers like me. Ordered for a Whiskey Smash and just kept repeating it. They could further enhance the experience by serving Sheesha as quite a lot of us would like to visit places which offer all of it under one roof.","id":44566486,"rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"12 hours ago","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1566069319,"likes":0,"user":{"name":"Ritajit Chakraborty","zomato_handle":"princi_rito","foodie_level":"Foodie","foodie_level_num":3,"foodie_color":"ffd35d","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/princi_rito?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/d18\/bfcaf04bb035d030e7cf8de218ba7d18.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/1897948"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"We were tended with extreme care by Victor, Senior Associate at this place.

Their Apple Cider, Weizenbock, was as good as any international craft. I have had such beer only in Belgium- Brussels and Bruges to be precise.

After confirmation from a senior person, I got assurance that a new batch had been brewed and was good- but alas!  When I visited today with hope to enjoy a nice mug of apple cider - I was sadly disappointed. Same bitter stale taste. Apparently the old stock had not finished yet. Wow!

I visited this place on a Tuesday evening with few of my friends for dinner. Among the house brews that they serve, I loved the Brew Masters Special,i.e., Lager Strong and the Gin based Grapefruit Negroni cocktail.  Some of the unique starters that we enjoyed were Gulabi Seekh Kebab and Masala Papad Crunch Fish Tikka where the fish was covered with papad was scrumptious in taste. If you are Upma lover, then Rawa Upma Cheese Balls is the dish for you to order here. Bacon Wrapped Potato bites was another mouth-watering item on the menu which literally had a layer of cheese sauce topped over it.\ud83e\udd24  Amid the large plates that we had, me being a hardcore non-vegetarian, loved the Farmer's Cottage Cheese Steak with Madras Curry Sauce. Middle Eastern style Lamb Chop served with olive mashed potatoes was also a delight to our mouths.\ud83d\ude0b  We were so full with the starters that we settled for the basic dal makhani with naan for the main course which was a great decision.  Ending our dinner with the desserts, we had Tiramisu(my favourite) and Molten Cake with Vanilla ice cream.  Do visit this place and share with me what all you liked

Broccoli never tasted as good as it did in the Khao Suey. You can tell that the ingredients are so fresh and there is no compromise in quality .The avocado ice cream was just perfect and I could actually taste the fruit. If anything, the bubble tea was not something I would recommend, I've had much better than a milkshake with tapioca pearls. Do let me know if you try any of my recommended restaurants.Thank you for being my +1, my darling @monicapillai.
